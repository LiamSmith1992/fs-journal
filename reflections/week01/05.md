# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

this week I think a lot went well. I enjoyed learning bootstrap a lot. I feel like getting the building blocks around a webpage is within my ability now.
I was surprised to learn as much as we did in just one week although i'm sure it's really not very much it is nice to see a webpage and start to think how i would be able to make it. 
i wasn't sure how this course would go and i feel confident in my learning so far.
I was struggling a lot with position of background images and using flex properties within bootstrap but i was understanding better each day with more practice.
I would count this whole week as a victory. i have never coded before and wasn't sure if i would even enjoy doing it. i think at least so far it is fun and i am excited to learn more.
