## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 
wire-framing helps to get your ideas organized and you can visually see what you want to create. After you see it written or drawn you can start to break it down piece by piece so it is not a huge project but a bunch of smaller projects.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
low-mid-high-fidelity.  low frame is good to help build the basic layouts without wasting too much time in the fine details that can come later.
mid is good to get functionality working and see how your site will work with most of the pieces all operating.
high is good to really get everything put how you want it. after spending so much time building something you might lose track of what you want it to look like at the end so the a detailed sketch can help you stay on track and create what you intended to create.
3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
i think low to mid frames are worth the time. low for sure will help get a project or idea contextualized and rolling. it is great to make a blueprint so you can focus on pieces that are not daunting.
