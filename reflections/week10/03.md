## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?
column is a placeholder to hold set values, a row is a set of values 
2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.
name VARCHAR(30), 
age INT,
description TEXT
3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```
delete from table takes a specific row out, drop table deletes everything that table held and the table itself
