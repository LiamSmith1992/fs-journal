## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?
value-contains data, reference-stores location of data, pointer-identifier
2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?
they are data constructs that have rules built in to what kind of data they will hold making it easier to manage and understand what is being shown
3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?
basically an id that can be used to find and pull the data so you do not store the entire value possibly multiple times
