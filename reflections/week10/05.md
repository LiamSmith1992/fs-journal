# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?



I am impressed with how much i understand when learning the basics of a new language in such a short time. i'm struggling with the basics of c# syntax i've understood in general but there are things in the repository specifically when using sql and then putting that data to an object and writing the function up top.
