# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


I learned how to access api's and how useful they can be to store data. I struggled with bools. Everyone says they are super easy but we didn't spend much time with them. I have had some trouble comprehending them in general. I used them in this project and got the hang of it for the most part so that was nice. I would count using api's as a victory i'm sure it will help down the road. Also i forgot where the reference was for a function i was making and had to just make it work pretty much. I successfully used a for loop to do what i wanted it to and the function worked perfectly.. doing it on my own felt really nice. the white boards paid off by showing how to look at a problem with no reference, pick a tool(in this case a for loop), and start working the logic out to make it work for the way it needs to.
