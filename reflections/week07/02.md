2. What are some benefits of Code Documentation?
it will keep it easy for other people to understand if you are sharing your code 
3. How important is Code documentation and why?
i would say it is medium because it is very useful but not always needed. some people i've listened to on podcasts mostly have talked about how nice it is but how they don't do it as often as they should. So for me I would put it important for me and all around medium
