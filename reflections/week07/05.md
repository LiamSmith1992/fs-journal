# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


Got the duck. pretty impressed with how far this course has taken me in just 7 weeks. Pretty much everything went well I still need help working through how to get things to dynamically change but i'm getting better. completing the tower in just 3 days was really cool. I went and looked at other event pages and started judging them it was a good time.
