We did not do this project and i just read this
2. What went well this week?
I think most things i am feeling competent in my ability to learn new things and use them. I feel like I have come a really long way in 7 weeks
3. What would you do differently?
probably watch the videos on vue I figured most things out but seeing the mvc and bootstrap videos really helped me learn something new while it was being taught
