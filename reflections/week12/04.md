today was good passed not fully complete. i was really having issues with the masonry but got help with how it is supposed to look. i like to put lots of div's in my html so i have all the pieces as easily movable as possible. that was causing major issues because the css for masonry was based of inheritance and was not reaching the div's in proper order.
