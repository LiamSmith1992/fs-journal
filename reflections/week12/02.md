# Daily Reflection
Two full days in! Did you make the progress you were hoping for yesterday and today? How are you working? Client -> Server, focusing only on the server for now?  

## Prompts
- How is today going? 
- Are you managing your stress?
- What has you most worried?

today is more stressful still having issues with the many to many and seems like i have  a lot of work left to do.
