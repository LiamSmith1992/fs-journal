man this is a tough week for me. did not fell comfortable with vue before starting the projects and some of the references got confusing with to much functionality. I did put the time in this week for the project and i think i got it as good as i could so i'm happy with that. just understanding how vue works from it's methods to passing information between different pages is a lot. this project was the hardest one so far i felt like i had gotten the js to js information passing and getting the appState to render changes down and vue seems to be easier but since there was so much new stuff to learn the when you get a problem that isn't working how you think it should, the knowledge to make things work is slightly more limited but after a while i found a way to do it.
